This project implements a Slack bot that uses OpenAI's GPT model for generating responses and can perform function calling, specifically for getting weather information.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `main.py`: The entry point of the application.

- `requirements.txt`: Lists all the Python dependencies.
- `.env`: Stores environment variables (this file should be in .gitignore).
